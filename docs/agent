== Configuring a Ruby Agent

Once the vertebra gem is installed you can generate a configuration file like
this:

  $ vutil generate_config

That will create /etc/vertebra/agent.yml, and it will make a backup if the file
already exists.

== Running a Ruby Agent

In order to run the agent all you have to do is:

  $ vagent start -c /etc/vertebra/agent.yml -d &

Under Linux you can add this to init like this (as root):

  # cat "vb:345:respawn:/usr/bin/vagent start -c /etc/vertebra/agent.yml" -d \
    >> /etc/inittab
  # telinit q
