== Where to get Vertebra

The source code is always available via Git:

  $ git clone git://github.com/engineyard/vertebra.git
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

When switching between branches you need to remember to update the
submodules. So to checkout the 0.3.0 tag to a branch you'd do this:

  $ git checkout -b 0.3.0 0.3.0
  $ git submodule update

Then when you went back to master you'd do this:

  $ git checkout master
  $ git submodule update

== Dependencies

We have provided a script that installs some dependencies in /opt/local/vertebra:

 * Erlang OTP (R12B-5)
 * ejabberd (2.0.2)
 * erlsom (1.2.1)

The following dependencies are not installed:

 * expat (most systems have this)
 * gcc (most systems have this, Macs need to install Xcode)
 * iconv (glibc systems have this, only needed for ejabberd mod_irc)
 * make (most systems have this, Macs need to install Xcode)
 * glib (most linux systems have this, needed for loudmouth)
 * loudmouth (see note below)
 * loudmouth-ruby
 * openssl (most systems have this)
 * ruby
 * rubygems
 * wget OR curl (this includes most Macs and Linux machines)
 * zlib (most systems have this)

=== Loudmouth

As of this writing the latest released version of loudmouth is 1.4.3. That
release has some behavior regarding whitespace that it emits in its XML that
causes trouble when that same XML is parsed. We have submitted a patch, but it
is not available in a released version, so it is included here as
loudmouth-whitespace.patch.

== Developer Installation

Vertebra has many moving parts, many of which you may or may not already have
installed. The install.sh script that is provided will do its best to safely
install everything you need to develop with vertebra.

To just install everything:

  $ ./deps.sh -a
  $ ./configure && make && make install

What it installs can be broken down into three categories: dependencies,
vertebra libraries, and vertebra actors.

==== Vertebra Libraries

 * vertebra -- Core agent library for ruby.
 * vertebra-erl -- Core agent library for erlang and core vertebra services.

==== Vertebra Actors

 * vertebra-gemtool -- Actor for managing ruby gems.
 * vertebra-xen -- Actor for accessing Xen slice information.

== Bugs

Currently there is an intermittent segfault in the ruby agent library. It seems
to be related to the loudmouth-ruby bindings.
