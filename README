== Where to get Vertebra

The source code is always available via Git:

  $ git clone git://github.com/engineyard/vertebra.git
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

When switching between branches you need to remember to update the
submodules. So to checkout the 0.3.0 tag to a branch you'd do this:

  $ git checkout -b 0.3.0 0.3.0
  $ git submodule update

Then when you went back to master you'd do this:

  $ git checkout master
  $ git submodule update

== Dependencies

The following dependencies are necessary to use this installer:

 * expat (most systems have this)
 * gcc (most systems have this, Macs need to install Xcode)
 * iconv (glibc systems have this, only needed for ejabberd mod_irc)
 * make (most systems have this, Macs need to install Xcode)
 * openssl (most systems have this)
 * ruby
 * rubygems
 * wget OR curl (this includes most Macs and Linux machines)
 * zlib (most systems have this)

== Developer Installation

Vertebra has many moving parts, many of which you may or may not already have
installed. The install.sh script that is provided will do its best to safely
install everything you need to develop with vertebra.

To just install everything:

  $ sudo ./install.sh -a

What it installs can be broken down into three categories: dependencies,
vertebra libraries, and vertebra actors.

In an attempt to not overwrite things that you may already have installed, the
installer will attmept to install things in /opt/local/vertebra. It will,
however, install rubygems using which ever gem command is on your PATH.

==== Dependencies

 * Erlang OTP -- If you already have the latest Erlang installed, then you can
                 skip this part.
 * ejabberd -- If you already have a running ejabberd server, read
               docs/ejabberd for assistance with configuring it to work with
               vertebra.

==== Vertebra Libraries

 * vertebra -- Core agent library for ruby.
 * vertebra-erl -- Core agent library for erlang and core vertebra services.

==== Vertebra Actors

 * vertebra-gemtool -- Actor for managing ruby gems.
 * vertebra-xen -- Actor for accessing Xen slice information.
