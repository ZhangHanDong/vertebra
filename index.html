    <div class="description">
      A secure, scalable and easy to manage framework for 
orchestrating complex processes in the Cloud.
    </div>

    <p>h3. Cloud-Agnostic

Vertebra is designed to be cloud-agnostic. It can be run on your own infrastructure, or on third-party providers' like Amazon's EC2 and VMware's VCloud. Vertebra provides a mechanism to advertise and discover services without regard to where they are running and uses a unique mechanism for scoping these advertisements for discovery and security purposes.

h3. Secure

Vertebra has a system to flexibly assign permissions in a work where different players may have conflicting interests. Similar to more venerable systems such as Domain Name Service and the e-mail system, Vertebra is designed to automatically federate. With a minimum of administrative overhead you can provide secure operations between any two Vertebra installations.

h3. Fault Tolerant

Fault tolerance is part of Vertebra's fundamental design philosophy. Vertebra can tolerate the failure of any or all of its core components. When they become available again, business continues as usual with no need for interaction from an operator.

h3. Easy to Manage

With all of the moving parts present in a distributed application, Vertebra provides a number of simple interfaces that make it easy to see which parts of the application are running, see where they are running, and provide job control functions to control them.</p><h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>We have provided a script that installs some dependencies in /opt/local/vertebra:
 
 * Erlang OTP (R12B-5)
 * ejabberd (2.0.2)
 * erlsom (1.2.1)
 
The following dependencies are not installed:
 
 * expat (most systems have this)
 * gcc (most systems have this, Macs need to install Xcode)
 * iconv (glibc systems have this, only needed for ejabberd mod_irc)
 * make (most systems have this, Macs need to install Xcode)
 * glib (most linux systems have this, needed for loudmouth)
 * loudmouth (see note below)
 * loudmouth-ruby
 * openssl (most systems have this)
 * ruby
 * rubygems
 * wget OR curl (this includes most Macs and Linux machines)
 * zlib (most systems have this)
 
h3. Loudmouth
 
As of this writing the latest released version of loudmouth is 1.4.3. That
release has some behavior regarding whitespace that it emits in its XML that
causes trouble when that same XML is parsed. We have submitted a patch, but it
is not available in a released version, so it is included here as
loudmouth-whitespace.patch.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Vertebra has many moving parts, many of which you may or may not already have
installed. The install.sh script that is provided will do its best to safely
install everything you need to develop with vertebra.
 
To just install everything:
 
  $ ./deps.sh -a
  $ ./configure && make && make install
 
What it installs can be broken down into three categories: dependencies,
vertebra libraries, and vertebra actors.
 
h4. Vertebra Libraries
 
 * vertebra -- Core agent library for ruby.
 * vertebra-erl -- Core agent library for erlang and core vertebra services.
 
h4. Vertebra Actors
 
 * vertebra-gemtool -- Actor for managing ruby gems.
 * vertebra-xen -- Actor for accessing Xen slice information.</p>
